        You seem to have stumbled upon my small corner of the internet.  This began as my Module 2: Advanced CSS Final Challenge but has evolved into my Module 20: React Portfolio Challenge. I have used the same foundation, but now I have implemented React. Using Routes and Paths, I have turned my old portfolio into a SPA (Single Page Application). <br/>
        In this particular challenge, I am using HTML, CSS, React, and Font-Awesome. I have contemplated using Bootstrap but I feel more productive using CSS at this current moment. CSS is an acronym for Cascading Style Sheets, which is sheet language that is being used to style a markup language. <br/>
        <br/>
        This portfolio has provided me with an endearing amount of difficult challenges, all which have helped hone my craft for coding. I plan for this site to evolve just as my coding abilities do.<br/>
        <br/>

        Feel free to have a look around, you might find something you like.
